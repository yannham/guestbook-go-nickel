## Guestbook Example in Nickel

WIP example of using Nickel to generate kubernetes configuration. Original
example: [guestbook
go](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/guestbook-go). The `.ncl`
and generated `.ncl.json` are new to this repository. All other files were
originally taken from the guestbook-go example. All are licensed under the
